                    My afternoon tour of the Whitney Plantation was a powerful oportunity to learn more about a truely evil institution and
                    a foundational aspect of American History. Our tour guide's description of the psycology
                    that is put into dividing a population will remain with me for the rest of my life. 
                    The imagery of Woodrow Nash's <em>Children of Whitney</em> scupltures will always remind me that
                    power imbalances and oppression need to be activly fought against, being passive will always let
                    them back through the cracks.
