                <p>
                    For my Into to Digital Photo final project, I wanted to combine my interest in still life with my experiences
                    working in Media Technology Services. I often hear that even with thousands of dollars of presentation technology
                    in each classroom, the overall sentiment towards the tech is neutral or negative. My photographs tried to present it in a way
                    that people on BC's campus haven't seen before, adding a colorful, and hopefully postive twist on technology that is
                    seen as purely a utilitarian tool.
