            <div class="col-8">
                <p>
                    This project was presented as the final for a Design Thinking elective in CSOM, taught by
                    Kristie Dickenson. As the course progressed through the human-centered design process, 
                    we would complete the parallel section of our project. I chose to tackle printing at BC
                    because procrastination with this process often contributes to students being
                    late for classes. Also, while some majors print much more than others, the majority of BC
                    students need to print out papers, articles, homework, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After considering the project's budgetary constraints, I realized that I would need to
                    address student awarness instead of attempting to hold a full scale assult on procrastination,
                    scheduling, and choice of workspace. The three prototypes below are all meant to build awareness,
                    whether for wait-times at specific printers or where printers are located on campus.

                    <p>
                        For my final version of the project, I used elements from a few of my prototypes.
                        The map shows all of the printers on main campus (along with 2000 Comm Ave.) and is
                        acompanied by a key and a QR code that directs a user to the printing homepage on
                        BC's website. The use of a large, bold san-sarif with heavy contrast was intented
                        to provide a clean read.
